	"place2": "<p>The wedding (ceremony, banquet, and the party) will take place on September 14th at Miravalle (Guadarrama, Madrid). The ceremony will start at 20:00 in the \"Jardín de la Cascada\", followed by a coctail in the same place. At around 21:30 we will go to the \"Salón El Escorial\" where the banquet will take place. Later on (at 01:00 at the latest) we will go to the disco, where we will dance for 4h.</p><p>We have chosen a Disney theme for the wedding, which does not mean you have to come disguised. The theme will be reflected by the decoration and other elements (like the Save The Date you should have received).</p>",

	"moreInfo": "<p>Miravalle has an easy access by car, with parking on-site. To get there from Madrid you just need to take the A-6, then the exit 42 in direction to N-VI, and after Collado Villalba on the second roundabout take the left exit in direction to Valle de los Caídos. Miravalle is right after the roundabout, with a big earthenware jar marking the gate. To arrive from the other direction, take the N-VI and the first roundabout you will find right after Guadarrama is the one with the exit to Valle de los Caídos.</p><p>If you are not planning to get there on your own, we had thought about getting a bus to take you from the center of Madrid to Miravalle, and then back when the party is over. If you prefer this option, let us know as soon as possible so we know how many people are interested in it when we contact the bus company.</p>",
	"gifts": "<p>We have already been asked about this. Seeing as we have been living together for more than 2 years, we already have everything we need as we have bought it when we have needed it. Moreover, every gift we receive would have to stay with our parents as we have to go back to Paris and we could not take it with us. For this reason having you with us at the event to enjoy it together is enough of a gift for us.<7p> <p> However, if you really want to give us something material, you can help us finance our honeymoon.</p>"
